# dSArt - an automated coordinate-based art generator for Desmos
Generator uses arrays of coordinates for art. 

Procedure for using the program:
- Use halfmonty's string art generator program found here to generate steps: https://halfmonty.github.io/StringArtGenerator/
  - Chromium will not work as it does not support js recursion for pins above 300. Please use FireFox instead. 
- Copy and paste the steps into provided dSArt_generatorExport.txt
- Run dSArt_Generator.py, copy generated coordinates from dS_coordinateExport.txt into desmos. Copy before wipe! 
- Refer to dSArt_ConsoleCMD.js for command to run in browser console to change graph form
