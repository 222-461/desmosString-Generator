# aCBA- an automated coordinate-based art generator for Desmos

  - Chromium will not work as it does not support js recursion for pins above 300. Please use FireFox instead. 
- Copy and paste the steps into provided aCBA_generatorExport.txt
- Run aCBA_Generator.py, copy generated coordinates from aCBA_coordinateExport.txt into desmos. Copy before wipe! 
- Refer to aCBA_ConsoleCMD.txt for command to run in browser console to change graph form
