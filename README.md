# aCBA- an automated coordinate-based art generator for Desmos
Generator uses arrays of coordinates for art. 

Procedure for using the program:
- Use halfmonty's string art generator program found here to generate steps: https://halfmonty.github.io/StringArtGenerator/
  - Chromium will work as it does not support js recursion for pins above 300. Use FireFox instead. 
- Copy and paste the steps into provided aCBA_generatorExport.txt
- Run aCBA_S0 program. Error can be disregarded
- If required, launch aCBA_OPTIONAL to reflect art against axis
- Copy generated coordinates from aCBA_coordinateExport.txt into desmos
- Refer to aCBA_ConsoleCMD.txt for commands to run in browser console to change graph form

- Launch aCBA_SR to delete all files generated during execution and to wipe generator input file
